A python program which scrapes google links and tests them for different types of web-based vulnerabilities

!DISCLAIMER!

This program is not intended to be used for malicious purpose. The authors of this project can not be held
responsible for any illegal activity conducted by its users!
It is designed for statistics and the results of the searches conducted should be disclosed in a respectful manner.

Critical TODO-List:

1. Format code and port to python3 (V3.4)

2. Write comments!

3. Re-write getproxy.py to be more readable, improve proxy-testing functionality

4. Write standardized tests to ensure the program stays functional

5. Re-write google-scraper to get around captcha by:

    -simulating real searches by passing normal queries

    -switching proxies when errors occur

6. Add argument functionality

7. Add support for different search engines and proxy lists

8. Add better output generation in vulnerability_scanner.py

Future TODO-List:

1. Implement more advanced tests

2. Option to crawl website and look for forms and other vulnerable parameters
